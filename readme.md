Each workshop that you design should address the learning objectives (**Chris, please take a look at them and tell us if any should be updated!**).  If you need inspiration, take a look at the workshops from the current term and in the `Archive` at term 2194 (https://github.com/Seneca-345305/Archive/tree/master/2194).

Upload the newly created workshops in the folder `2211 - Winter 2020` in this repository.

***The workshops that you design should be new, not a modified version of previous workshops!***
